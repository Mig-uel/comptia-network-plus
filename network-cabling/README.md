# Networking Cabling

## Intro to Network Cabling

Wireless networking has become increasingly popular and easy to set up, but wired networking remains the most reliable and fastest option for many applications.

### 802.3 Standards

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 standards define the physical and data link layers for wired Ethernet networks. These standards cover various types of cabling, speeds, and protocols used in Ethernet networking.

This set of standards, also known as **Ethernet**, defines the protocols for wired LAN technologies, covering aspects like frame formats and physical layer specifications.

This is an older set of standards, but it is still widely used in modern networking.

### Network Cable Properties

- **Transmission Speeds**:
  - Copper cables achieve speeds of up to 40 Gbps.
  - Fiber optic cables can reach speeds of up to 100 Gbps and beyond.
- **Distance Limitations**:
  - Copper cables typically can reach distances of 1,000 meters (3,609 feet) for standard Ethernet.
  - Fiber cables can reach distances of up to 40 kilometers (24.85 miles) or more, depending on the type of fiber used.
- **Duplex Modes**:
  - **Half-Duplex**: Data transmission occurs in one direction at a time.
  - **Full-Duplex**: Data transmission occurs simultaneously in both directions.

### Cable Speeds

**Cable** speeds vary based on the type of cable used, impacting network performance; Ethernet cables like **Cat5**, **Cat5e**, **Cat6**, and **Cat6a** support different maximum speeds and frequencies over varying distances.

**Coaxial Cables** are used for broadband internet, supporting high-speed data transmission, while **Fiber Optic Cables** (single-mode and multi-mode) offer the highest speeds and longest distances for data transmission.

Key factors affecting cable speed include cable quality, installation practices, and environmental conditions.

### Network Cable Properties

- **Noise Immunity**:

  - EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) is a condition where external electromagnetic signals interfere with the data transmission in cables, leading to data corruption or loss.
  - Copper cables are more susceptible to EMI
    - Shielded cables (STP) provide better protection against EMI compared to unshielded cables (UTP).
  - Fiber optic cables are immune to EMI as they use light for data transmission.

- **Frequency**:

  - Measured in MHz, frequency indicates how many cycles per second a cable can handle.
  - Higher frequency cables can support higher data rates.
  - For example, Cat5e cables support frequencies up to 100 MHz, while Cat6a cables can handle frequencies up to 500 MHz.

- **Attenuation**:
  - Attenuation refers to the loss of signal strength as it travels through a cable.
  - It is measured in decibels (dB) and increases with distance.
  - Higher quality cables have lower attenuation rates, allowing for longer transmission distances without signal degradation.

## Coaxial Cable

Coaxial cable, or coax, consists of a central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer insulating layer. It is commonly used for cable television and broadband internet connections.

Coaxial cables is a type of electrical cable consisting of a central conductor, an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer insulating layer. The design of coaxial cables helps to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and allows for high-frequency signal transmission. It is commonly used for cable television, broadband internet connections, satellite communication, and other applications requiring reliable data transmission over longer distances.

**RG-6** and **RG-59** are common types of coaxial cables used in networking and television applications. RG-6 is thicker and has better shielding, making it suitable for longer distances and higher frequencies compared to RG-59.

Coax is thicker and has better shielding compared to twisted pair cables, making it suitable for longer distances and higher frequencies. However, it is less flexible and more expensive than twisted pair cables.

It is commonly used in residential and commercial settings for its durability and high-quality signal transmission.

### Coaxial Cable/RG-6

- **BNC Connector**:

  - Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) connectors are commonly used with coaxial cables for secure and reliable connections.
  - They feature a twist-lock mechanism that ensures a tight fit, reducing the risk of signal loss or interference.
  - Commonly used in the old bus and ring network topologies.

- **F Connector**:
  - F connectors are widely used for cable television and broadband internet connections.
  - They screw onto the coaxial cable, providing a secure connection that minimizes signal loss.
  - F connectors are commonly used in residential and commercial settings for their ease of installation and reliable performance.
