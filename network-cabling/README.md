# Networking Cabling

## Intro to Network Cabling

Wireless networking has become increasingly popular and easy to set up, but wired networking remains the most reliable and fastest option for many applications.

### 802.3 Standards

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 standards define the physical and data link layers for wired Ethernet networks. These standards cover various types of cabling, speeds, and protocols used in Ethernet networking.

This set of standards, also known as **Ethernet**, defines the protocols for wired LAN technologies, covering aspects like frame formats and physical layer specifications.

This is an older set of standards, but it is still widely used in modern networking.

### Network Cable Properties

- **Transmission Speeds**:
  - Copper cables achieve speeds of up to 40 Gbps.
  - Fiber optic cables can reach speeds of up to 100 Gbps and beyond.
- **Distance Limitations**:
  - Copper cables typically can reach distances of 1,000 meters (3,609 feet) for standard Ethernet.
  - Fiber cables can reach distances of up to 40 kilometers (24.85 miles) or more, depending on the type of fiber used.
- **Duplex Modes**:
  - **Half-Duplex**: Data transmission occurs in one direction at a time.
  - **Full-Duplex**: Data transmission occurs simultaneously in both directions.

### Cable Speeds

**Cable** speeds vary based on the type of cable used, impacting network performance; Ethernet cables like **Cat5**, **Cat5e**, **Cat6**, and **Cat6a** support different maximum speeds and frequencies over varying distances.

**Coaxial Cables** are used for broadband internet, supporting high-speed data transmission, while **Fiber Optic Cables** (single-mode and multi-mode) offer the highest speeds and longest distances for data transmission.

Key factors affecting cable speed include cable quality, installation practices, and environmental conditions.

### Network Cable Properties

- **Noise Immunity**:

  - EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) is a condition where external electromagnetic signals interfere with the data transmission in cables, leading to data corruption or loss.
  - Copper cables are more susceptible to EMI
    - Shielded cables (STP) provide better protection against EMI compared to unshielded cables (UTP).
  - Fiber optic cables are immune to EMI as they use light for data transmission.

- **Frequency**:

  - Measured in MHz, frequency indicates how many cycles per second a cable can handle.
  - Higher frequency cables can support higher data rates.
  - For example, Cat5e cables support frequencies up to 100 MHz, while Cat6a cables can handle frequencies up to 500 MHz.

- **Attenuation**:
  - Attenuation refers to the loss of signal strength as it travels through a cable.
  - It is measured in decibels (dB) and increases with distance.
  - Higher quality cables have lower attenuation rates, allowing for longer transmission distances without signal degradation.
