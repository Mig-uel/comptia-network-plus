This inventory ensures **timely access to vendor support** and prevents disruptions in network operations due to expired warranties or support contracts.

### IP Address Management (IPAM)

**IP Address Management (IPAM)** is a critical aspect of network management that involves **tracking and managing IP address allocations** within a network.

It helps **prevent IP address conflicts, optimize address space usage, and ensure efficient network operations**.

Effective IPAM practices include maintaining a centralized database of IP addresses, subnets, and associated devices, as well as implementing automated tools for monitoring and managing IP address assignments. It also aids in compliance and strategic network planning by ensuring efficient use of IP address resources and supporting future network growth.

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of service, performance metrics, and responsibilities of both parties.

It outlines the **quality, availability, and responsiveness** of the services provided, including uptime guarantees, response times for support requests, and resolution times for issues.

SLAs are essential for **setting clear expectations, ensuring accountability, and providing a framework for measuring service performance**. They help organizations manage service delivery, maintain customer satisfaction, and establish a basis for resolving disputes related to service quality.

### Wireless Survey and Heat Maps

A **wireless survey** is a process of **assessing the wireless network coverage and performance** in a given area. It involves measuring signal strength, interference, and other factors that affect wireless connectivity.

Heat maps identify the **optimal placement of access points** and help in planning the wireless network layout to ensure **adequate coverage, capacity, and performance**.

Heat maps visually represent the **wireless signal strength** and coverage across different areas of a building or campus, allowing network administrators to identify dead zones, areas of interference, and potential improvements in the wireless infrastructure.

They are **generated from data collected during the wireless survey** and provide a color-coded map that indicates signal intensity, helping in the design and optimization of wireless networks for better performance and user experience.

## Network Devices End-of-Life (EOL) Management
