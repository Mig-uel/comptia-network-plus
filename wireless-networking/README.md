## Wireless Combo Devices vs. Dedicated Devices (OB 2.3)

The primary way people connect to networks today is through wireless networking. There are two main types of wireless networking devices: wireless combo devices and dedicated wireless devices.

Beforehand, let's go over two terms people generally confuse, **wireless routers** vs. **wireless access points**.

In a typical home network or small business network, you would typically have a single device that acts as a combination of a wireless router, a wireless access point, a network switch, and a network firewall. This device is often referred to as a **wireless combo device** or simply a **wireless router**.

Versus, on a corporate network or enterprise network, you would typically have dedicated devices for each function. For example, you might have a dedicated wireless access point that connects to a separate network switch and a separate network firewall.
