## Convert Decimal to Binary (OB 1.7)

To convert a decimal number to binary, follow these steps:

1. Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. Record the quotient and the remainder.
3. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient is 0.
4. The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order (from last to first).

### Example

Convert the decimal number 13 to binary:

1. 13 ÷ 2 = 6, remainder 1
2. 6 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 0
3. 3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1
4. 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Reading the remainders in reverse order gives us: 1101
Thus, the binary representation of the decimal number 13 is **1101**.
