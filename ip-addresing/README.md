# IP Addressing

## Convert Decimal to Binary (OB 1.7)

To convert a decimal number to binary, follow these steps:

1. Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. Record the quotient and the remainder.
3. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient is 0.
4. The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order (from last to first).

### Example

Convert the decimal number 13 to binary:

1. 13 ÷ 2 = 6, remainder 1
2. 6 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 0
3. 3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1
4. 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Reading the remainders in reverse order gives us: 1101
Thus, the binary representation of the decimal number 13 is **1101**.

## Structure of an IP Address (OB 1.7)

> Note: 8 bits is a number between 0 and 255.

Let's talk about the structure of an IP address, specifically IPv4 addresses.

Let's represent an IPv4 address as so:

```
x.x.x.x
```

Where each `x` represents 8 bits (also known as an octet). Therefore, an IPv4 address consists of 4 octets, making a total of 32 bits.

To add more, that means that each `x` can have a value between 0 and 255 (since 2^8 = 256 possible values, ranging from 0 to 255).

An IPv4 address is 32 bits long, divided into four octets of 8 bits each. Each octet can represent a decimal value from 0 to 255.

The first octet can indicate the class of the IP address (A, B, C, D, or E), which determines the network and host portions of the address. The remaining octets are used to identify the specific network and host within that network. Also, the first octet can only go from 0 to 223 for standard unicast addresses.
