# Network Fundamentals

## What is a Network?

A computer network is a system of interconnected computers and other devices that can communicate and share resources and information with each other.

Networks can be categorized by their size and structure.

The main purpose of all networks is to share resources and information efficiently (e.g., data, devices, applications, etc.).

A basic network consists of just two machines connected together, sharing files and resources. However, most networks are much larger and more complex.

A switch (we will cover switches in more detail later) is often used to connect multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). It allows data to be sent and received between devices on the same network.

Why do we setup networks? We setup networks so that devices can communicate with each other and share resources such as files, printers, and internet connections.
