# Network Fundamentals

## What is a Network?

A computer network is a system of interconnected computers and other devices that can communicate and share resources and information with each other.

Networks can be categorized by their size and structure.

The main purpose of all networks is to share resources and information efficiently (e.g., data, devices, applications, etc.).

A basic network consists of just two machines connected together, sharing files and resources. However, most networks are much larger and more complex.

A switch (we will cover switches in more detail later) is often used to connect multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). It allows data to be sent and received between devices on the same network.

Why do we setup networks? We setup networks so that devices can communicate with each other and share resources such as files, printers, and internet connections.

## Devices on a Network

When we are setting up a network, we will have to know all the different devices that are on the network.

### What is on a Network?

- **Host**: Hosts are devices or systems on a network that use, provide, or share resources and services, such as computers, servers, and network-enabled devices. Generally, any device with an IP address can be considered a host (e.g., computers, smartphones, tablets, printers, etc.).
- **Server**: A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can host websites, manage emails, store files, and run applications (This is a type of host).
- **Workstation**: A workstation is a high-performance computer designed for technical or scientific applications. It is typically used by professionals for tasks that require more power than a standard personal computer (This is a type of host).
- **Client**: A client is a computer or device that accesses services, applications, or resources provided by a server over a network. Clients can be desktops, laptops, smartphones, or tablets (This is a type of host).
- **Network Devices**: Network devices are hardware components that facilitate communication and connectivity within a network. They allow servers, workstations, and clients to connect and interact with each other. Such devices are switches, routers, Access Points (APs), and firewalls. (These are also types of hosts).

## Types of Networks (OB 1.6)

The types of networks that exist are limited to the geographical area they cover.

- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A LAN is a network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or building. It covers a small geographical area like a home, office, or building. LANs are typically used for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet connections among connected devices.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent. The internet is the largest example of a WAN. WANs are used to connect multiple LANs together, allowing communication and resource sharing over long distances.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A MAN is a network that covers a larger geographical area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically spanning a city or metropolitan area. MANs are often used by organizations to connect multiple LANs within a city for resource sharing and communication.
- **Campus Area Network (CAN)**: A CAN is a network that connects multiple LANs within a limited geographical area, such as a university campus or business complex. CANs are used to facilitate communication and resource sharing among different buildings or departments within the campus.
- **Storage Area Network (SAN)**: A SAN is a specialized network designed to provide high-speed access to consolidated storage devices. SANs are primarily used to enhance storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, making them accessible to servers so that the devices appear as locally attached to the operating system.
- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: A PAN is a network that connects devices within a very small area, typically within a person's immediate vicinity. Examples of PANs include Bluetooth connections between a smartphone and wireless headphones or a smartwatch.
