## Hardware vs Virtual Appliances (OB 1.2)

Physical appliances are **dedicated hardware devices** focused on specific networking tasks, such as firewalls, routers, or switches, offering high performance and reliability but at a higher cost and with space requirements.

Virtual appliances are **software-based solutions** that run on virtual machines, providing similar functionalities as physical appliances but with greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, but potentially at the expense of raw performance.
