# Network Devices

## Hardware vs Virtual Appliances (OB 1.2)

Physical appliances are **dedicated hardware devices** focused on specific networking tasks, such as firewalls, routers, or switches, offering high performance and reliability but at a higher cost and with space requirements.

Virtual appliances are **software-based solutions** that run on virtual machines, providing similar functionalities as physical appliances but with greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, but potentially at the expense of raw performance.

## Router (OB 1.2)

When you have a network, you are going to want to connect it to other networks. For example, let's say you have a home network with multiple devices, and you want to connect to the outside world (the internet). A router is a device that connects your home network to the internet, allowing your devices to communicate with other devices on different networks.

A router operates at the **network layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model, directing **data packets** between different networks based on their IP addresses. It uses routing tables and protocols to determine the best path for data to travel.

Routers use **routing tables** to determine the best path for forwarding data packets to their destination, connecting **multiple networks** together, such as a local network to the internet.

Routers also provide network security features like **firewalls** and **VPN support**, helping to protect your network from unauthorized access.
